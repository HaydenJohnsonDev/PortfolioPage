## Project Purpose

This project is meant to serve a variety of purposes. It is meant to be a "hub" of sorts to send to a prospective employer, or anyone who would like to see what I have been working on. 

That being said, I would like this to be a continual work in progress. It never really needs to have a single final version. When learning new things throughout my own developer journey, I would like to in some way apply them here. Not intending to muddy up the page as a whole with half finished paths and features, but applying features to make it more interesting then a simple digital business card.
