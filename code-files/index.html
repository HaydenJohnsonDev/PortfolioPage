        <p>Hello! My name is Hayden Johnson, I am 21 years old, and living over in Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p>
        <p>As a Colorado resident, rock climbing is one of my favorite methods of staying active.</p>
        <p>As seen in the picture above, my family also enjoys hiking the various "14ers" that spread across our stretch of the Rockies.</p>

          <li>And Many Other Small Projects</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="infoBlock">
        <p>At that point, we were doing all of that just for our own enjoyment, I hadn't really thought of pursueing it full time. My family convinced me to look into the options and I later found Thinkful. I am now studying to be a Software Engineer, and I cannot wait to get into the field.</p>
